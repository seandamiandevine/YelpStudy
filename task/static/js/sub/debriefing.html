		<p style="text-align:left">Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
		important contribution to science. </p>

		<p style="text-align:left">The purpose of this study was to invesigate how people make real-world decisions depending on the context.
      The sets of restaurants you saw were not random. The set contained various combinations of high and low rated restaurants.
    The main hypothesis in this study was that people's restaurant choices and expected satsifaction depended on the <b>average</b> rating of the other restaurants in the set.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left"> Take for instance a restaurant with a 3-star rating.
      If you are choosing from a group of restaurants that are all rated poorly (1-2 stars), you may have higher expectations for this restaurant because it is surrounded with less reputable restaurants.
      On the other hand, you may have lower expectations for this <i>same</i> restaurant when the other options are higher rate (e.g., 4-5 stars).
      This process is called <b>value normalization</b> and we want to explore how humans make such contextual decisions.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left">We thank you again for your participantion in helping us better understand this question.</p>

		principal investigator, Sean Devine (seandamiandevine@gmail.com).</p>
